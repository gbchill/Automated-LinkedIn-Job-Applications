# LinkedIn Auto Job Application Bot

Hey there! This is my fun little project that automates job applications on LinkedIn using Selenium. 

**Note:** This is not a serious project, just something I did for fun and to learn about web scraping and automation. It's not meant for actual job applications but for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You need Python installed on your machine.
- Make sure you have the `selenium` and `webdriver-manager` libraries installed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:


### Usage

1. You need to have a valid LinkedIn account with your login email and password.
2. Update the `ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, `ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`, and `PHONE` constants with your LinkedIn login credentials.

### Running the Bot

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the bot.
2. You will need to solve the CAPTCHA manually when prompted.
3. The bot will open LinkedIn job listings, click the "Apply" button, and fill in your phone number.
4. It will automatically skip complex applications and continue.
5. You can see the bot in action as it applies to jobs on the page.

**Caution:** This bot is meant for educational purposes only. It ignores multi-step and note-required job applications. Using it for real job applications on LinkedIn is not recommended and may violate LinkedIn's terms of service.

## Acknowledgments

I learned how to use Selenium for web automation through online tutorials and documentation. Thanks to the open-source community for creating such helpful resources.
